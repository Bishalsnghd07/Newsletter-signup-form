## The challenge

My challenge is to build out this Newsletter sign-up form with success message web page.


Users should be able to:
- Incorporated **DOM** manipulation to make changes in html🌠. 
- And used ***Error handling*** and ***Event listener*** by using DOM manipulation. When submitting the form, if you fill wrong `inputs` or leave form as empty, then error will catch and the message for this error will say ***"Valid email required"*** and unable to submit the form.📄
- If you fill your email correct then your *form will be submit* and you will see Thanks message by displaying that **Thanks for subscribing and a confirmation message will be sent to "entered" mail** and also **integrated dismiss button** below by clicking on that you can dismiss the thanks message.
- Also updated, with modern secure email format validation technique like, if you enter your email without the extension ***".com"*** or if you write any other extension then you will unable to submit the form and you"ll see a error message like this 👉 **Valid email required**.
- Utilizing ***DOM*** manipulation, when a form is submitted and an incorrect email is entered, an onChange event listener on the email input field will trigger, continuously updating with error messages until a correctly formatted email is provided." 
- Added **hover**🔥 on submit button with new look, make sure to view it.
- Secured a flawless **100%** Lighthouse score across performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO benchmarks, showcasing our commitment to excellence.📊
- Integrated **ESLint** for code quality assurance and maintainability.🛠️
- Implemented **autoprefixer** for seamless CSS compatibility across different browsers, ensuring a consistent user experience.🌐
- View the **optimal layout** for the section depending on their device's screen size
- See **focus-visible** states for all interactive elements on the page❤️

In addition, I added some *email format validation, focus-outline none, transition effect* as well in submit button.

## What I learned

This project enhance my skills in basics **JavaScript concepts** like, *Event Handling, DOM Manipulation, Error Handling(client-side validation), Conditional rendering and Next.js Image component*. 

In before intro **sign up component** project, I implement **DOM Manipulation** and make changes in html by using javascript DOM. So, it becomes easier for me to start this project with approach. But, adding new javascript topics in this project like, **Event Listener** which I learn during this project, it's give me a **strengthen** in my basics and I will not say it's a big challenge for me, I will say it's a good challenge enhance my skills in basics of javascript. First I used **Event handler** for detect error in inputs from html which is bit a **complex** and **time taking** but for **code maintainibility** and time management I **revert back** to use event listener, in this I direct taking **validate input** from DOM and passed to the **handleChange** function. So, in this case when we **submit form**, if there is any error in input field. Then *handleChange* function will track each character is matching ***email format*** or not. After, correctly passes email in **input field** then we able to submit the **form successfully**. 

I learnt it from ***youtube*** and ***chatGPT***, it helps me a lot to ***overcome*** this challenge. And it is the basics of javascript, which we use in **live project** in daily basis and as well as in **personal projects** too

*Overall, I'm happy with my progress and want to dip dive more in javascript.*

## Continued Development
- Organised code to enhance **reusability** and **readibility** in many concerns, what I did it, I make different organised component for the **reusable icons** and passed as a *prop* in the main component, to maintain *code quality* and *code cleaniliness*.
- I would love to work on **tailwind CSS** and would *explore* more **JS Library** and will continue *implement* in my further projects.
- For **client side Validation** I used pure javascript, can be use *react form* and *zod* easily, but wants to enhance my skills in pure javascript *DOM manipulation, Error Handling, Event listener and conditional rendering* with live projects, will use react form or can be zod in **larger project** to enhance *code flow*.
